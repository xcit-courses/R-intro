# R Course Exercises

Welcome to the R programming course exercises!

## Getting Started with Binder

Click the button below to launch an interactive RStudio environment in your browser:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xcit-courses/R-intro/main?urlpath=rstudio)

**When RStudio opens, your working directory will automatically be set to the `exercises/` folder!**

This will open RStudio in your browser with all the necessary R packages pre-installed. 


### Launch Directly to Exercises Folder

Open RStudio with the exercises folder as your working directory:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xcit-courses/R-intro/main?urlpath=rstudio&filepath=exercises)

This URL parameter (`filepath=exercises`) will navigate directly to the exercises folder when RStudio opens.

### Launch with Specific File Open

Open directly in RStudio with a specific file:
```
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xcit-courses/R-intro/main?urlpath=rstudio&filepath=exercises/exercise_01.R
```

### Important Notes
- **Sessions are temporary** - Download your work before closing the browser
- **Inactivity timeout** - Sessions close after ~10 minutes of inactivity  
- **No persistent storage** - Everything resets when you close the tab
- **Free to use** - mybinder.org is a free service
- **No account needed** - Just click and start coding
