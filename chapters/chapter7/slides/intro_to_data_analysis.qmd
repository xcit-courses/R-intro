## Demo

- Let's have a look at a specific dataset and do some analysis together.

-   Open `lab_analysis_intro`, available on [Github](https://github.com/xcit-courses/R-intro-labs).

-   If you don't have R and RStudio running locally, you can use the following [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xcit-courses/R-intro-labs/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio) instead.

-   Note however that your progress will not be saved if you use Binder!
