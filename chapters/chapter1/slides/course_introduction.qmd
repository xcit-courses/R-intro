## Why this course?

[![Wikipedia](/chapters/chapter1/images/the_scientific_method.png){fig-alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" fig-align="center" width="600"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)

Students are often not well prepared to integrate all the steps of this loop. They lack practical skills to implement the data analysis and reporting efficiently and in a way that can be reproduced.

## Data science workflow

Programming is the "glue" that binds all of these steps.

## Freedom and empowerment

-   You are restricted when using "tools" developed by others;

-   If you learn to create your own "tools", the possibilities become endless.

-   You will gain in efficiency and freedom (you can delegate work to computers).

-   You will better understand the digital world.

## Learning by doing

This is a hands-on course!

No homework, no grading.
